            with emphasis in big data analytics. I want to one day work for a huge tech company
            like Apple or Google, but honestly, I just would like to work on really cool projects
            and change the world with them. this website is just a hub for my internet footprint.

                so the video above is basically my favorite video at the moment lol. so more about myself,
            I like to play electric guitar. I own a 2017 Professional Series Sunburst Fender Telecaster.
            The amp I use is the Boss Katana and its honestly all I will ever need when it comes to doing effects
            on my guitar. I also like to run. I am not really as competitive running as I was before. I used to run
            cross country and track in high school, but now it is more of a healthy lifestyle. I like to program as well.
            I currently know how to program in C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL and PHP. I have made some roblox games
            so I guess you can say a roblox version of lua. I have been programming since the 5th grade now and
            I still have much to learn. I want to one day build a super cool game, a sick machine learning program, and
            my own operating system from scratch. (that last one is gonna be quite the challenege) as smaller hobbies go,
            I love to play video games. My favorites being Sonic, Just Cause, minecraft, and portal. My favoite movies are
            inception, interstellar, get out and tron: legacy. I love to eat fried chicken, sushi and hot dogs. I like to 
            drink thai tea boba. I want to get a tesla or some super cool ev in the future. I love apple products and their
            ecosystem. I enjoy listening to Vampire Weekend, The Beatles, and Oasis. But most of all, I love God and praise him
            for his almighty nature, eternal love and everlasting peace. He has been so faithful to me and has blessed me with
            the most amazing people in my love. I am truly greatful for Him and the many friends and family I have. I think thats it..
